# Decisions log

Where the build plan proved wrong or underspecified, the change and the reason are
recorded here. Newest last.

## 1. Paginate Congress.gov by offset, not by following `pagination.next`

**Plan:** follow `pagination.next` until absent.
**Finding:** the live API returns malformed `next` links, with the path repeated
inside the query string, e.g.
`https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/119?/bill/119?limit=3&sort=updateDate desc&offset=3&limit=3&format=json`
(recorded in `packages/congress-client/test/fixtures/congress/bills-list.json`).
**Decision:** `next` is used only as the "more pages exist" signal; the client
requests the next page itself by advancing `offset`. It also stops when
`offset >= pagination.count`.

## 2. List-level `updateDate` is a date, not a date-time

**Finding:** bill list items carry `updateDate: "2026-10-08"` (no time), even though
`fromDateTime` filters on the full timestamp.
**Decision:** the hourly bill cursor is not "max `updateDate` seen". Each run
works through a fixed window `[from, to)` where `to` is the run's start time. If a
run stops early (budget or time), it stores the window and the offset reached;
the next run resumes the same window a few items before that offset (re-reads
are harmless upserts). When a window completes, the cursor becomes `to` minus
five minutes of overlap.

## 3. Census geocoder: pin the district layer to the sitting Congress

**Finding:** the default `Current_Current` vintage already returns
"120th Congressional Districts" (mid-decade redistricting). An Austin address is
TX-10 on those lines but TX-37 for the sitting 119th Congress.
**Decision:** the geocoder looks for the layer named for the current Congress and
falls back through older vintages (`ACS2025_Current`, `ACS2024_Current`, …) until
it finds it. State legislative districts keep the newest lines. Federal reps come
from our own `members` table by state and district; state legislators come from
Open States `people.geo` by coordinates.

## 4. House roll-call member positions arrive in one response

**Plan:** fetch `/members` per vote in two pages.
**Finding:** the recorded response for 119-1-17 returns all 434 positions with no
`pagination` block, even with `limit=250`.
**Decision:** the client still loops defensively (by offset) in case that changes,
but expects one request per vote.

## 5. Shared hourly request budget

The backfill (GitHub Actions) and the hourly sync (Edge Function) use the same
Congress.gov key, so per-run caps alone could exceed 5,000 requests/hour together.
**Decision:** every job records its requests in `api_usage` (per API, per clock
hour) and starts with `min(own cap, 4,800 − used this hour)`.

## 6. Job locks are leases, not advisory locks

Edge Functions may connect through a transaction-mode pooler, where session-level
advisory locks are not reliable. `sync_lock` holds a lease with an expiry
(`try_sync_lock` / `release_sync_lock`), so a crashed run's lock frees itself.

## 7. Vote pages use a query-string route

**Plan:** `/votes/[id]/`, client-rendered.
**Decision:** GitHub Pages cannot serve an arbitrary path without a prerendered
file, so the client-rendered vote page lives at `/vote/?id=house-119-2-80`
(mirroring the `/bill/?id=…` fallback).
